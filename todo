- white face on scan looks rotated (maybe it doesn't adapt when we first change face after scanning the first color)
- forceUnsolvedCube with errors

- change colors of the virtual cube (make more closer to real colors)
- change cube rotation if movement is hard to see (smart rotator)
- cube is solving yellow face first, instead of white (change)

- don't allow white and yellow face for first scan

- add animations for stopping camera when completing scan
